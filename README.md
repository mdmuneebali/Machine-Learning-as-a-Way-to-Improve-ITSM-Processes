# Machine Learning as a Way to Improve ITSM Processes
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying Machine Learning techniques to improve IT Service Management (ITSM) processes. The goal is to use historical IT service data to better understand incident behavior, reduce manual effort, and support faster and more informed decision-making in IT operations.

The project was developed as part of an academic/client-based data science project, with practical implementation using Python and standard machine learning workflows.

📖 Project Description

In this project, I analyzed historical ITSM incident data to identify patterns related to ticket categories, priorities, and resolution behavior. The dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for analysis. After that, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends in incident volume and high-priority tickets.

Machine learning models were then applied to predict and classify service incidents, especially focusing on identifying critical issues early. These predictions can help IT teams respond faster, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall service efficiency.

The project demonstrates how machine learning can be practically used in ITSM environments to move from reactive issue handling to a more proactive and data-driven approach.
